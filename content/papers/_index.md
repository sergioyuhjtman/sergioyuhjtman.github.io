## Selected papers explained

Research papers are typically addressed to specialized audiences. 
While this is necessary, it excludes many people who might otherwise appreciate them.
The idea here is to present the content of some of my papers to a broader audience.

Thus, in some sense, all of physics is mathematical physics. 
In a more restrictive sense, mathematical physics is a discipline that 
delves deeper into the mathematical aspects of these models.
